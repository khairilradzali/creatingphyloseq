# creatingphyloseq
Phyloseq is mainly a package to analyze data consisting of operational taxonomic unit (OTU), metadata, taxonomy, and phylogenetic tree (optional).

Objectives of the repository: 
1. To create a mock OTU table, taxonomy, metadata, and phylogenetic tree
2. To merge the input files as a phyloseq object for further metagenomic analysis

The scripts are adapted from https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/
